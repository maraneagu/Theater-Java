# Theater-Java

Project implemented in the Advanced Oriented Programming course of my fourth semester at FMI. Managing a theater, in two parts: visiting the theater itself, adding, removing and listing different components of it and visiting the theater's ticket shop, where you are able to buy and cancel a ticket for an event from the theater's repertoire.
