# Theater-Java

Project implemented in the Advanced Oriented Programming course of my fourth semester at FMI. Managing a theater, in two parts: visiting the theater itself, adding, removing and listing different components of it and visiting the theater's ticket shop, where you are able to buy and cancel a ticket for an event from the theater's repertoire.

### Database / Workbench

To stock the data of this application, I've used MySQL, writing the SQL code in MySQL Workbench. Here are the SQL commands for creating the actual tables: [MySQL Theater Commands.](https://github.com/maraneagu/Theater-Java/blob/main/MySQLTheaterCommands.txt)

### Sign up / Log in

The first step when you start the application is the sign up/log in part. Here you can see how I logged in with the username @admin, who is able to add and remove componenets in the application:

### Theater / Ticket Shop

After you are successfully logged in, the next step is to choose which part of the application do you want to visit. You can either:
- Visit the theater;
- Visit the theater's ticket shop;
- Log off your current account.

### Theater

I am first going to walk you through the Theater part of the application, where, logged as @admin, you are able to create the theater itself, adding, removing and listing spectacles, actors, dancers, singers and events.

### Ticket Shop

The theater's ticket shop is the same for both @admin and regular users: you can buy, cancel and list tickets of the theater's events.
